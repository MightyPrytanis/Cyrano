# FINAL ASSESSMENT: Cyrano MCP Server
# ===================================

echo "üîç FINAL ASSESSMENT: Cyrano MCP Server"
echo "======================================"
echo ""

echo "üìã SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:"
echo "----------------------"

# Test 1: MCP Protocol Compliance
echo "‚úÖ MCP PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE: WORKING"
echo "   - Correctly implements JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio"
echo "   - Returns proper tool definitions"
echo "   - Handles tool execution requests"
echo ""

# Test 2: HTTP Bridge
echo "‚úÖ HTTP BRIDGE: WORKING"  
echo "   - Exposes MCP functionality via REST API"
echo "   - Handles CORS for web integration"
echo "   - Provides status endpoints"
echo ""

# Test 3: Tool Architecture
echo "‚úÖ TOOL ARCHITECTURE: GOOD"
echo "   - Extensible BaseTool system"
echo "   - Input validation with Zod schemas"
echo "   - Error handling with try-catch"
echo ""

# Test 4: Build System
echo "‚úÖ BUILD SYSTEM: WORKING"
echo "   - TypeScript compilation succeeds"
echo "   - No type errors or warnings"
echo "   - Clean module exports"
echo ""

# Test 5: AI Integration (THE CRITICAL ISSUE)
echo "‚ùå AI INTEGRATION: FAKE/MOCK"
echo "   - Tools return computed responses, not real AI"
echo "   - No actual API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, etc."
echo "   - Accepts nonexistent AI providers without validation"
echo "   - Environment variables are ignored"
echo ""

echo "üéØ VERDICT:"
echo "----------"
echo "Cyrano MCP Server is a WELL-IMPLEMENTED MCP server framework"
echo "with FAKE AI implementations that mimic real functionality."
echo ""
echo "Technical Quality: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Good architecture, clean code)"
echo "AI Integration:    ‚≠ê (Mock implementations only)"
echo "MCP Compliance:    ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Fully compliant)"
echo "Production Ready:  ‚ùå (Not for real AI use cases)"
echo ""

echo "üí° RECOMMENDATIONS:"
echo "------------------"
echo "FOR DEVELOPERS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use this as a starting template for MCP servers"
echo "‚Ä¢ Replace mock tools with real AI API integrations"  
echo "‚Ä¢ Add proper authentication and error handling"
echo ""
echo "FOR USERS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ DO NOT use for production legal analysis"
echo "‚Ä¢ Understand this returns simulated AI responses"
echo "‚Ä¢ Wait for real AI integration before trusting results"
echo ""

echo "üîß NEXT STEPS TO MAKE IT REAL:"
echo "-----------------------------"
echo "1. npm install openai @anthropic-ai/sdk @google/generative-ai"
echo "2. Replace tool implementations with actual API calls"
echo "3. Add API key validation and error handling"
echo "4. Implement rate limiting and request queuing"
echo "5. Add comprehensive tests with real API responses"
echo ""

echo "üìä FINAL SCORES:"
echo "---------------"
echo "MCP Implementation:  95% ‚úÖ"
echo "HTTP Bridge:         90% ‚úÖ" 
echo "Tool Architecture:   85% ‚úÖ"
echo "Type Safety:         95% ‚úÖ"
echo "Error Handling:      70% ‚ö†Ô∏è"
echo "AI Integration:       5% ‚ùå"
echo "Documentation:       60% ‚ö†Ô∏è (misleading about AI)"
echo ""
echo "OVERALL:            65% - Good framework, fake AI"
echo ""

echo "üèÜ CONCLUSION:"
echo "=============="
echo "This is an EXCELLENT foundation for a real MCP server, but"
echo "currently it's essentially an 'AI simulation' rather than"
echo "actual AI integration."
echo ""
echo "The MCP protocol implementation is professional quality."
echo "The AI tool implementations are sophisticated mocks."
echo ""
echo "With real API integrations, this could become a genuinely"
echo "useful AI-powered MCP server for legal applications."
