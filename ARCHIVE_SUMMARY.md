# SWIM MEET PROJECT - ARCHIVED (January 18, 2025)

## Archive Status: FUNDAMENTAL BUTTON ISSUE UNRESOLVED

### Critical Issue
- **Root Problem**: All interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns, tabs) render visually but JavaScript event handlers completely non-functional
- **Scope**: Affects React components, raw HTML with onclick attributes, and simple alert() functions
- **Diagnosis**: Confirmed NOT component-specific - indicates fundamental build/JavaScript execution issue
- **Platform**: Issue persists across multiple configuration attempts on Replit environment

### Final Diagnostic Results
- **Test 1** (Raw HTML): `onclick="alert()"` - FAILED
- **Test 2** (React Simple): `onClick={() => alert()}` - FAILED  
- **Test 3** (React Complex): Event handlers with state - FAILED
- **Conclusion**: JavaScript event binding completely broken at environment level

### Attempted Solutions (All Failed)
1. Radix UI component replacement with native HTML
2. React event handler syntax corrections
3. Build configuration optimization (removed Replit plugins)
4. TypeScript/JSX configuration review
5. Component library overhaul
6. Multiple diagnostic isolation tests

### Project Assets Available for New Implementation
- **Complete Source Code**: React/TypeScript frontend, Express backend
- **AI Orchestration**: 8-provider integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- **Database Schema**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL setup
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui library with aquatic theme
- **Architecture Documentation**: Comprehensive system overview

### Technical Stack (Proven Working Except UI Events)
- Frontend: React 18.3.1, TypeScript, Vite build
- Backend: Express.js, PostgreSQL, AI service integrations
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, aquatic/varsity theme
- Real-time features: Connection status, response tracking

## Project Discontinued - New Implementation Required
**Reason**: Unresolvable environment-level JavaScript event handling failure
**Next Steps**: Fresh implementation on different platform/environment
